DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK : Task 4: Implement a machine learning model using scikit-learn to classify or predict outcomes from a dataset. This task includes data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation. You will handle missing data, split the dataset into training and testing sets, train a model (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression), and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or RMSE. The final deliverable is a Python script or Jupyter notebook that includes model implementation, evaluation, and performance results.

OUTPUT : In code
